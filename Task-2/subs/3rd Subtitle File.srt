1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, for the first improvement by me is add this (picture slider)

2
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,500
and change the background.

3
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:23,000
So, the background by me is show the logo of the "Mi Ayam".

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:32,000
And, maybe add that one (background) so the points and message can be clearly seen, like that.

5
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, the next maybe the concept is same with this,

6
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:46,000
add "Delete Account" in the setting page.

7
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:52,500
Maybe not too far different with this because

8
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:59,500
from me it's just like adding (an improvement), like that.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
And also adjusted with the design.

10
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,000
And also adjusted with the design. / Yes.

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Then, for the "Edit Profile", delete (input field) instagram and facebook, right?

12
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,500
Yes.

13
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:25,500
Yes, instagram and facebook. So the display is full one page and no need to scrolling down. Like that.

14
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:31,800
So it's straight from e-mail, name, (phone) number, birth date, straight to delivery address. Like that.

15
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:53,000
And then, for the detail menu, because the text on the previous design is over to "add" button, it's changed like this so it's not over (to "add" button). Like that.

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Maybe this is will be a bit same with the second design, because the focus is to improve or to revise an over sentences. Like that.

17
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay. / Okay.

18
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,500
Nah, for the design by me

19
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:20,500
the first is the picture on the top maybe can be changed, so the points and the message are more clearly.

20
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,500
The previous design is too disguised.

21
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:30,500
And then, add the picture slider to this, so the pictures are automatic slide, without the user slide the pictures manually.

22
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:38,000
Nah, for the navigation itself, if the "plus" sign is clicked, then the display like this will appear.

23
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:44,000
Nah, if (the user) wants to (order) delivery (and click delivery button), then "menu restoran" page will appear.

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:53,000
Nah, from the "menu restoran" page, an improvement is maybe on the description. The description is arrange neatly, so the description didn't collide with "add" button.

25
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,000
So it's neatly in this version.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Nah, then, from the menu "account" is also add "delete account"

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
same as the first design

28
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,500
so the users can delete their account.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The different from Izzat's design is in icon.

30
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, the different is in the icon.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, that's right.

32
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:24,500
Then, in "Edit Profile" part, it's the same (with design 1), delete  (input field) instagram and facebook

33
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,000
so, maybe it can be simpler.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
[There are 5 people that participated on design voting: Diyah, Nila, Annisa, Mia, and Alliya]

35
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:42,500
Assalamualaikum Warrahmatullahi Wabarakatuh

36
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:47,500
Here I will do evaluation for the design that have been presented.

37
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:54,500
The first is I will talk over the background in "Home" menu.

38
00:03:54,501 --> 00:04:03,500
So, according to me, the first design already has a nice background 

39
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:16,500
because it has a logo in the middle, so it looks better and more attractive if compared with the second design

40
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:26,500
because the background in the second design is only solid color background, so it seems less attractive.

41
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:34,500
Then, the second that I will discuss is the carousel where also located in the "Home" page.

42
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:42,500
According to me, the carousel in the first design is less attractive

43
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:51,500
because the circles is too close to the promo above and the promo below, so it seems less attractive.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Nah, for the second design, according to me, the circles is better and more attractive because there are colors in the circles too.

45
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:07,000
Then the third is the "Menu" part.

46
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:20,000
According to me, the "Menu" part in the first design is better, because the reason is in menu detail.

47
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:31,000
According to me, menu detail from the first design is more clearly and more detail because it also desribe the flavours

48
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:39,000
meanwhile in the second design, in my opinion, an explanation is less obvious

49
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:45,000
and didn't reflect the menu.

50
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Then the fourth, in "Account" part, exactly in "Delete Account" part.

51
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,000
According to me, the part of "Delete Account" in both first design and the second design is nice

52
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:12,500
because for the first design, I like the "Delete Account" icon

53
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:19,500
because the "Delete Account" icon in the first design is more common if compared to the second design

54
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:30,000
because commonly, delete icon that has been a lot or common in the application or web is the form of garbage.

55
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:49,000
But, I also like the "Account" design of the second design because the second design gives more space, so its more pleasant to be seen by user

56
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:52,500
and seems more clearly.

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Then the last that I'll discuss is an "Edit Profile" part.

58
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:04,500
According to me, an "Edit Profile" part in the second design is better 

59
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:14,500
because, for the "delivery address" part, in the first design is too close with the "birth date" part

60
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:20,000
so, it seems less good for the user too.

61
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:29,500
A whole of both the design, according to me is already nice. But if I was asked to choose, I choose the first design.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Before voting, allow me to give a sight about plus and minus of the first design and the second design.

63
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:42,500
For the first design, the minus is an inconsistent font when add "Delete Account" feature.

64
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:47,500
The font should be the same with the other font. Or if want to change the font, then change all of it.

65
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,500
Then, for the points and message icon that located in "Home" page

66
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:57,500
its visible that the stroke and border of the icon are thin whereas the original design is already good

67
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:05,500
but what I like in the first design is when you put the logo on the top middle of "Home" page, it's really nice for branding.

68
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:12,500
Move to the second design, the plus of the second design is when click plus button, there will appear delivery and reserve button.

69
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,500
Then, the automatic slider part is good too.

70
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:21,500
Then in "Menu" revision part between both design are almost resemble, right?

71
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:28,500
So, at the end, going to more like or will vote the second design.

72
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:38,500
So, I choose the second design because the design is more concise.

73
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:43,500
Then, I like the design of the voucher, it's unique.

74
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:49,500
And in the menu, it's described completely.

75
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm Mia Amelia, I want to give my sight for both of the design.

76
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:02,500
According to me, I more like the second design

77
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,500
because there are some features like: the pictures can be slide automatically 

78
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:12,500
so user don't have to slide manually

79
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:17,500
and there's navigation button, in my opinion it's more attractive.

80
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:21,500
Then, the background in the top middle can be replaced

81
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:26,500
so I more like and vote the second design.

82
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:33,500
So, I ask permission to opine plus and minus from each design.

83
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:40,500
For the first design, I like it because 

84
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:48,000
there's a logo, so the "Home" page is not too lonely

85
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:55,000
and its clarify that this application indeed belong to Mi Ayam Jamur Haji Mahmud.

86
00:09:55,001 --> 00:10:05,500
Then, the minus is on a slide part, the slide icon is less contrast with the background

87
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:15,500
So sometimes, I'm as a user of other application doesn't know that it can be slide.

88
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:22,500
Then for the points icon, for me it's a bit less attractive because

89
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,500
the shape is less attractive, because it's too Microsoft Word's shape.

90
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:45,500
And then, in "My Account" part, the fonts is different and don't same, so it less pleasant to seen.

91
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:53,500
Then, in "Edit Profile" page, in "delivery address" part, the font is different.

92
00:10:53,501 --> 00:11:00,500
And according to me, it's too high, eh, too close with birth date.

93
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:12,500
For the second design, I like because the font is same (consistent) and already neat. 

94
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:20,500
Then, seems like the "My Order" font is less to the right.

95
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,000
Then also

96
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,500
the color of the slides, the orange circles are already contrast with the background, so although the feature already automatic slide

97
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:42,500
but it's like, we know that we can slide manually.

98
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Then I also like the navigation, so it's like, give us choice directly whether we want to delivery or reserve.

99
00:11:53,001 --> 00:12:00,000
Maybe the red one, for me it's too dark, so it can be enchance.

100
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,500
Then, the minus of the second design is the part of "Home" page on the top, is a bit lonely

101
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:16,500
so, it like less contains. So it can be added by logo.

102
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,000
So, that's all.

103
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:26,500
Then if I was asked to choose from both of those design, I prefer the second design.

104
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you.
