Kak Bowie : Hello

Izzat : Yes, I’m sorry to interrupt your time, 

Kak Bowie : Oh Yes, it’s alright.

Izzat : Beforehand, i’d like to introduce myself, good afternoon, we are computer science students in the year of 2018 from University of Jakarta, from us there is myself,Izzat who contacts you via Instagram then there are my friends Diyah and Rachel.

Kak Bowie : Sorry, who are the other two?

Izzat : Diyah Anggraeny and Rachel

Kak Bowie : Oh Rachel, afternoon, I’m Kevin

Rachel,Diyah : good afternoon

Izzat : Beforehand, can you introduce yourself?

Kak Bowie : Greeting, maybe from the status hehe. I’m Kevin Bowie. My location is in Medan. For college, I studied in Mikroskil, No one knows. It’s Okay even if it’s an unpopular private school. I studied from 2013 and graduated in 2018. Right now I’m working as a programmer in a company. And for the application that Izzat saw, that’s a freelance.

Izzat : Yes,Kak

Kak Bowie : That’s a freelance job, not from the company

Izzat : Alright Kak. Thank you for the introduction. Beforehand, Thank you to sparing your time for this meeting and also Thank you for giving us a permission to evaluate the app that we talked about yesterday which you made

Kak Bowie : How is it? Is it good?

Diyah : It’s good Kak. So, we got an assignment for Human Computer Interaction which is to search an application and evaluate that app. In this terms, your app. After that, we have to make an improvement regarding that app and also ask for a feedback from its app developer

Rachel : So,here, we had made a few improvement regarding the app. Wait a minute, let me share that. Here is the improvement that we had made. First, for the home slide, we did an improvement which is it can move by itself. If from the application, it has to be swapped right Kak?

Kak Bowie : Yes,Yes

Rachel : by the user right? Our improvement suggestion is probably for it to move by itself.

Kak Bowie : how many seconds its better to move for the user?

Rachel : probably around 5 to 10 seconds

Kak Bowie : 5 to 10 seconds right? Don’t be too fast right?

Rachel : Yes kak. Secondly, for the account page, in the app there is no delete account option, so we suggest to add delete account option for user to delete their account

Kak Bowie : Why?

Rachel : Yes Kak?

Kak Bowie : Why delete the account?

Rachel : probably because they had finished the order Kak

Kak Bowie : What I want is for them to repeat the order

Rachel : Oh right

Kak Bowie : it’s kind of troublesome. But it’s up to you

Rachel : Thirdly, in the edit profile page. For the facebook and instagram input, we deleted it.

Kak Bowie : oh really? Why?

Diyah : because we think probably that’s less efficient, Why should input media social in here, What do you think about it?

Kak Bowie : It’s actually a request from the client, they want to polish the gun hehe. Personally, I think I’m agree. But it’s for the client, so it’s hard. 

Rachel : Yes, it’s usually the client request, right?

Kak Bowie : Yes, client request is usually unusual

Rachel : for the last, menu restaurant, so we did a little fix for the description so it can be read fully

Kak Bowie : Okay wait a minute let me see. In the description,right?

Rachel : Yes, description for the menu restaurant

Kak Bowie : oh Yes it should be like that so it can be more neat, or is there a maximum row?

Rachel : Probably it can be added, the maximum row

Kak Bowie : maximum row, probably two is enough

Rachel : Yes kak, so there it is all the improvement from us, probably you can give us some feedback?

Kak Bowie : If the last app, What is it? Not automatic and it shows the next slide 

Rachel : yes, right

Kak Bowie : if it’s like that probably it’s less good for the user compared to the automatic one.

Diyah : Yes, for user it’s probably more good if automatic and also look more modern

Kak Bowie : yes if it’s automatic. Later maybe I’ll try to tell my client. 5 seconds right? How about 3 seconds?

Rachel :  if 3 seconds I think it’s too fast

Kak Bowie : too fast, too fast, right. For the delete account, if the user want to order again, how is it? Do they have to regist again?

Rachel : Yes,kak if they decided to delete their account

Kak Bowie : let’s say they had delete their account then one day they want to order again via app, they have to regist again then right?

Rachel : Yes Kak that’s right

Kak Bowie : that’s too troublesome don’t you think?

Rachel : Yes probably

Kak Bowie : how about nonactivate account?

Rachel : It’s also alright

Kak Bowie : for example, if the user wants to activate their account they can contact the cs 

Rachel : the administrator right?

Kak Bowie : yes the admin. Then activate and the user just have to reuse the account again after I gave the list of data right?

Rachel : that’s right kak

Kak Bowie : it’s better like that. For delete account position I think there is No problem. How If put it in the edit section?

Rachel : it’s also fits I think, put it in the bottom

Kak Bowie : in the bottom, how if it gets clicked?

Rachel : You’re right hehe

Kak Bowie : Yeah that’s it. For the facebook I’m also agree on that actually but because of the client. For the description menu, maximum row is two right? For the Size I think it fits, not too small and not too big

Rachel : for the Size I think it already fits

Kak Bowie : it means that it is parallel with the add button right?

Diyah : Yes kak

Kak Bowie : Okay then i’ll save it first

Diyah : it means that you agree with deleting media social input, for menu description also, for the delete account, it’s better to nonactivate account. 

Kak Bowie : Yes nonactivate

Diyah : Nonactivate and for the automatic slide, do you agree?

Kak Bowie : actually for me, am I agree or not? If it’s automatic I’m afraid of this, for example when seeing the banner, suddenly it moves, I’m afraid of that

Rachel : it is also a consideration right?

Kak Bowie : yes but I don’t know I never try, for example when reading, if i touch the screen ,is it possible to stop. If it’s possible than it’s good.

Izzat : Yes probably it’s enough kak for the presentation design evaluation and feedback from you. Probably let’s just end this because we also don’t want to interrupt your time this afternoon. More or less, we’re sorry for probably there are words that less condescend

Kak Bowie : Yeah it’s okay. Good luck

All : Thank you so much kak
