## 1st Day Subtitle

Izzat : from the design of login page, is there anything to improve? Personally, I think it’s already good. There is nothing to improve.

Rachel : personally, I think login page is already Clear. There are email, password and also forget password.

Izzat : there is also a sign up. But, for the sign up, is it already support? What is it?using Google? What is it called? The one using Google?

Rachel : is it the one that goes straight away?

Izzat : Yes

Diyah : Let’s see, is the sign up page screenshoted?

Izzat : This one, right? Oh Yeah. If it’s from this one?

Rachel : I think it’s possible to goes straight with Google

Izzat : possible,right? Because of this one (shows icon)

Diyah : Yes

Izzat : is there any revision for the home page like login and sign up?

Diyah : I don’t think there is, personally

Izzat : personally, I also think this one is enough

Rachel : I also think it is enough for sign up

Izzat : Let’s just continue,then?

Rachel : Yes

Izzat : This is home menu, right?

Diyah : Yes, that’s right

Rachel : Yes, that’s the home page

Izzat : do you think the color is kinda hazy with the background? (Shows inbox icon) Do you think the inbox logo is visible?

Diyah : personally, I think it’s still visible

Rachel : isn’t the points icon that’s kinda hazy?

Diyah : Yes, because the background is also yellowish

Izzat : There is a yellowish logo, right?

Rachel : Yes, and for the points isn’t it better to place it in the account?

Izzat : That’s right. The choice of background probably is also kinda not good?

Diyah : Yes. The page also doesn’t look interesting.

Izzat : Yes. But, actually for the icon is already simple and being made as simple as possible.

Rachel : Probably the content should be improved?

Izzat : Yes, right.

Diyah : as I analyze the app, the promo in the upper part should be swapped to see, I think it’ll be more good if that could be automatic.

Rachel : Oh, the mie ayam catering part?

Diyah : Yes

Rachel : So, it’s better to make it like a carousel so it can be automatically changed?

Diyah : Yeah that’s What I think.

Izzat : Without having to slide to see, right, Diy?

Diyah : Yes, I think it can make it more interesting

Izzat : for the edit profile part?

Rachel : personally I think there is something to add which is delete account

Izzat : delete account? In the most below part?

Rachel : Yeah, I think so. Because there are only address, phone number, born date but there is no delete account choice.

Izzat : it can be. So there should be delete account inside edit profile or inside the setting part?

Diyah : I think outside the edit profile (setting part)

Rachel : I think it’s better outside

Izzat : outside? So,here? (Shows where)

Rachel : probably add a new choice in the setting part?

Izzat : Yeah

Diyah : I got an additional in edit profile part

Izzat : Yes?

Diyah : there are input for instagram and facebook. I think it’s unnecessary. I don’t think there should be an instagram and facebook input.

Izzat : Yes.That’s true. It’s less essential, right?

Diyah : Yes

Izzat : so, for the personal data instagram and facebook it should be deleted. Anything else?

Rachel : I think it’s enough for the profile part

Izzat : So, it’s done for the profile part. Okay,Next. Oh right, actually what is this sign for? (Shows add button) Is it for reservation? Or Is it to add order or something?

Rachel : So, when you click that button, there are two choices which is delivery and reservation.

Izzat : Okay. Personally, I think this part is enough (shows reservation part)

Rachel : personally, I think it’s enough for the reservation part

Izzat : Enough, right? I also don’t have something to evaluate in the reservation part

Diyah : personally, I also think it’s enough

Izzat : Okay, so after the reservation, for the order history i personally think it’s already good. From the information that you don’t have any order and the picture, I think it’s good.

Rachel : it’s good but because there isn’t any order we don’t know for sure

Izzat : Okay.So for this part there is nothing to improve. 

Rachel, Diyah : Yes

Izzat : Next one. My balance, What is it for?

Rachel : For the points, I think it’s already good. There is also the description.

Diyah : Okay then, that’s enough

Izzat : Alright, after my balance, let’s review menu page 

Rachel : is it for the delivery?

Diyah : Yes, that’s for the delivery menu

Izzat : Delivery, menu delivery. Okay, so What do you guys think about this? Personally I think this is good but probably the composition is being too forced. See, this is too close

Diyah : Yes,I’m also agree on that one

Izzat : True, right?

Rachel : Yes,that’s true

Izzat : I think it just needs to be more bigger probably

Diyah : the room? (section)

Izzat : yes, because when you see it normally (Size), the menu all looks the same, you can’t tell the difference. that’s it, I think that’s the minus.

Rachel : Right, it needs more explaination?

Izzat : Yes, more explaination. And if possible, the detail shouldn’t be too close to the add logo. Next, to this one. Do you guys think there is something to revise?

Rachel : I think it’s done

Diyah : I think so too

Izzat : Okay, enough then

Rachel : So only have to request order

Izzat : Yes, just have to order

Rachel : i think it’s already clear

Izzat : Already clear? Personally, I think there is nothing more to improve

Diyah : same. There is nothing to add from me

Rachel : So, this is if you are successfull to do reservation?

Izzat : Yes,this is if you are successfull to do reservation, you have to do confirmation. If this one? What is it? This is if for the reservation detail,right?

Diyah : Yes

Izzat : So,after this,confirm to Whatsapp with format determined by the authorities,right?

Rachel : Yes, by the authorities

Izzat : Then, What do you guys think about it?

Rachel : I think it’s less effective if you have to confirm by Whatsapp

Izzat : That’s right. It makes the essential of the application is lessen. Because we have to check Whatsapp then check the application. Because in Whatsapp, we also just have to confirm the reserve number

Rachel : confirm payment?

Diyah : Actually the choice is also kind of confusing. Because it says payment by cash but we have to pay by transfer.

Rachel : Yes, that’s also true

Izzat : Right,right,right. So if it’s payment by cash it should be paid in the place,right?

Diyah : it should be

Rachel : Yes

Izzat : Okay, because it’s less effective, we probably have to improve the confirmation to be done by the websites

Rachel : it can be. The payment is also like if it’s by transfer then it should be by transfer

Izzat : make it more clearer right?

Rachel : Yes,maybe

Diyah : I think that’s it for the interaction flaw
